*Recap Object Localization*  
In computer vision tasks, we have 3 main tasks:  
*   Image Classification: assigning a class label to an image.  
*   Object Localization: drawing a bounding box around one or more objects in image.  
*   Object Detection: drawing a bounding box each object of interest in the image and assigning them a class label.  

Together, all of these problem referred to as object recognition.  
Additionally, one extension of computer vision tasks is object segmentation which is more challenging (also called "object instance segmentation" or "semantic segmentation"). In this task, we highlight the specific pixels of the object instead of drawing a bounding box.
